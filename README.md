#Dot Files

Configuration files (often called dot-files because they start with a ".") for
the applications I use on a regular basis. 

More details about specific application configurations can be found in their
respective directories.

###Requirements

You'll need `make` for the automated linking of the dotfiles.
Obviously you'll need the related program for each config file to be applicable.

##Installation
> 1. git clone git@github.com:VagabondAzulien/dotfiles.git
>
> 2. cd dotfiles
>
> 3. Type `make` to see your options
