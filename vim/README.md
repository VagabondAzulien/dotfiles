#Vim Configuration Files

My vim configuration is relatively straight forward.

###RC File
* Word-wrap is set to 80 characters
* Spaces not tabs; tab-length set to 5
* Wild menu

###Directory
Additionally, I have several extensions, as submodules, in .vim/bundle:
* [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for nice Git integration.
* [Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) to look nice, but not garish.
* [Sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak) for getting around.
* [Vinegar](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar) for a convenient directory
  browser.
* [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) to do the hard work.
* [Templates](https://github.com/ap/vim-templates.git) for easy templates.

###Font
I prefer using the Droid Monospace font for powerline, which is bundled here for
convenience.

####To-Do
* [ ] (Optional) Customize Airline more.
* [ ] Consider adding [gist-vim](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim) due to
  prevalence of Gist at work
* [ ] Consider adding [vim-notes](https://github.com/xolox/vim-notes) and/or
  [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for notes
