#Dot Files

Configuration files (often called dot-files because they start with a ".") for
the applications I use on a regular basis. 

No special pre-requisites, that I'm aware of. The `install` script requires
Python. Of course, the configuration files require the related applications
to be applicable.

More details about specific application configurations can be found in their
respective directories.
