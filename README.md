# Dot Files

Configuration files (often called dot-files because they start with a ".") for
the applications I use on a regular basis. 

More details about specific application configurations can be found in their
respective directories.

### Requirements

You'll need `make` for the automated linking of the dotfiles.
Obviously you'll need the related program for each config file to be applicable.

## Installation
> 1. git clone git@github.com:VagabondAzulien/dotfiles.git
>
> 2. cd dotfiles
>
> 3. Type `make` to see your options

## Applications Configured

### Vim
My vim configuration is relatively straight forward and thoroughly commented.

#### Plugin File
The vimrc-plugins file stores the plugin information for
[Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Included in the file is a
command to check for and pull-down the vim-plug files, if not previously
installed. All configurations related to plugins goes into this file also, so if
I want a plugin-free install, I can ignore this file and still run fine.

Notable Plugins
* [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for nice Git integration.
* [Polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot) for language files.
* [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for info, diary and notes.
* [goyo](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) for zen-like text editing.

### Tmux
My tmux configuration is very straight forward and fully commented. Of note, I
enable mouse mode, and have custom colors configured.
