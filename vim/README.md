#Vim Configuration Files

My vim configuration is relatively straight forward.

###RC File
* Word-wrap is set to 80 characters
* Mappings to quickly edit dotfiles
* Relative numbering, with mapping to quickly swap

###Bundles File
The vimrc.bundles file stores the plugin information for Vim-Plug. Currently, I
use the following plugins:
* [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for nice Git integration.
* [Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) to look nice, but not garish.
* [Sneak](https://github.com/justinmk/vim-sneak) for getting around.
* [Vinegar](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar) for a convenient directory
  browser.
* [Templates](https://github.com/ap/vim-templates.git) for easy templates.
* [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for info, diary and notes.

###Pending Plugins
The following should be eventually installed and configured properly:
* Syntastic
* vim-startify
* vim-dispatch

####To-Do
* [ ] Customize Airline more (Optional)
* [ ] Consider adding [gist-vim](https://github.com/mattn/gist-vim) due to
  prevalence of Gist at work
* [ ] Look into [ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) for more awesome
  searching.
* [ ] Get color situtated.
