#Vim Configuration Files

My vim configuration is relatively straight forward. I comment most lines.

### Bundles File
The vimrc.bundles file stores the plugin information for
[Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). Included in the file is a
command to check for and pull-down the vim-plug files, if not previously
installed. All configurations related to plugins goes into this file also, so if
I want a plugin-free install, I can ignore this file and still run fine.

## Notable Plugins
* [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for nice Git integration.
* [Vinegar](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar) for file browsing.
* [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) for info, diary and notes.
* [Startify](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-startify) for a nice start-page
* [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) for syntax checking.
