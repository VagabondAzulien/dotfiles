#Tmux Configuration Files

My tmux configuration is very straight forward. Of note, I enable mouse mode,
and have custom colors configured. I also have a few custom scripts.

### Tmux Addons
- [TPM](https://www.github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm): The TMUX Plugin Manager
- [Scroll-Wheel Copy Mode](https://www.github.com/nhdaly/tmux-scroll-copy-mode)
- [Resurrect](https://www.github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect): Session
  Management

### Custom Scripts
- clocks.sh/rb: My custom status bar. Shows time for 4 different time zones,
  plus the date and weather of my default home location.

- copy\_selected.sh: Enables uploading of the selected text to Gist.
